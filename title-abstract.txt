Title:
Leveraging RAG for enhancing AI Interactions in Generative Agents

Abstract:
In the field of artificial intelligence, the challenge of simulating believable human behavior agents in dynamic environment is crucial for agents’ auton- omy and decision-making capabilities. Recent work introduced by the pa- per ”Generative Agents: Interactive Interaction of Interpersonal Behavior” simulates the interaction for NPCs in a virtual town, generating agents’ ac- tions with their memory and attributes of each agents and environment set- tings. Previous implementations, particularly using GPT3.5, faced limitations in sustaining long-term simulations and encountered issues with generating believable interactions, often leading to memory ’illusions’, and the cost for GPT3.5 model is high for us to reproduce the model. Our project introduce the Llama 2 model from HuggingFace, valued for its speed and zero cost, to simulate agents interactions, aiming to replicate human behavior patterns. We enhance agents’ memory consistency by building Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Llama Index for memory retrieval, allowing agents to act based on past memories stored in vector databases. This approach marks significant improvement over our initial method of simply appending actions and plans to a memory list. We will compare the actions generated by both approaches, and assess the semantic similarity of these different actions and their initial plans.
